# Alien-Invaders-A-Horizontally-scrolling-shooter-game
This is my repo following the implementation of the Space Invaders game. Inspired by the book "Python Crash Course", by Eric Matthes, and nicely implemented by GitHub user githubhidde. Many challenging targets has been reached and the original code refactored.
