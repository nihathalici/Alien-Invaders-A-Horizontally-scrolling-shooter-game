# Alien Invaders | A horizontally scrolling shooter game

This is my repo following the implementation of the Space Invaders game. Inspired by the book "Python Crash Course", by Eric Matthes, and nicely implemented by GitHub user githubhidde. Many challenging targets has been reached and the original code refactored.

___
## Challenging Targets:

* [x]  Sideways Shooter: Write a game that places a ship on the left side of the screen and allows the player to move the ship up and down. 
* [x] Game Character: Find a bitmap image of a game character you like or convert an image to a bitmap. 
* [x] Stars: Find an image of a star. Make a grid of stars appear on the screen.
* [x] Sideways Shooter Part 2: Add a fleet of aliens, and make them move sideways toward the ship.
* [x] Press P to Play: Because Alien Invasion uses keyboard input to control the ship, it would be useful to start the game with a keypress.
